# MakeMapsFromWorlds
A simple program to create heightmap and colourmap from an existing world.
Download MakeMapsFromWorlds.exe to your RPGWorld user directory.
Run it. Select a world to map. When the maps are drawn, click save maps. Two .bmp image files will be created.

This little program makes it easy to recreate a world devoid of props and/or change the colours of a world -
E.G. use your paint/draw program to select a colour and change it to another - spring to autumn, autumn to winter.
